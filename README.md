# ChromaPlot

**ChromaPlot** is a Python application designed for creating high-quality figures of chromatogram data from Cytiva Ã„KTA systems. It provides an easy-to-use interface for visualising and analysing your chromatographic data.

## Features

- **Single Mode**: Generate plots of single datasets with customisable options for adding/removing instrument traces, changing line styles, colours, adding shaded areas, and more.
- **Overlay Mode**: Compare multiple datasets by overlaying them on the same plot, with full customisation of each trace. Particularly suited to analytical size-exclusion chromatograms.
- **Analysis**: You can currently add a vertical marker to your plots to measure values at specific curve positions. This a work in progress, and other analytical tools will be added in the future.

A guide on how to use the features of ChromaPlot is provided within the app, however if you have any questions or need help, please reach out to us via [GitHub](https://github.com/beh22/ChromaPlot) or [email](mailto:billyehobbs@gmail.com).
