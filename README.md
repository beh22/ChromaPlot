# ChromaPlot

**ChromaPlot** is a Python application designed for creating high-quality figures of chromatogram data from Cytiva Ã„KTA systems. It provides an easy-to-use interface for visualising and analysing your chromatographic data.

## Features

- **Single Mode**: Generate plots of single datasets with customisable options for adding/removing instrument traces, changing line styles, colours, adding shaded areas, and more.
- **Overlay Mode**: Compare multiple datasets by overlaying them on the same plot, with full customisation of each trace. Particularly suited to analytical size-exclusion chromatograms.
- **Analysis**: You can currently add a vertical marker to your plots to measure values at specific curve positions. This a work in progress, and other analytical tools will be added in the future.

A guide on how to use the features of ChromaPlot is provided within the app, however if you have any questions or need help, please reach out to us via [GitHub](https://github.com/beh22/ChromaPlot/issues) or [email](mailto:billyehobbs@gmail.com).

**Disclaimer**: While we have taken steps to ensure that ChromaPlot is safe and secure, the app has not been officially notarized by Apple. If you have any concerns about security, feel free to review the source code available in this repository or run from the source code as described below.

**Why This Happens**: Apple's security system, Gatekeeper, protects users by ensuring that only apps from identified developers are installed without extra steps. To become an identified developer, a paid Apple Developer account is required, which is not feasible for every open-source project.
